# Underwater_Pipeline_Detection_Computer_Vision_Classical_CV
Utilizing classical computer vision methods for the specific task of detecting underwater pipelines. It implies that the detection process involves analyzing images captured underwater, likely employing traditional image processing and computer vision algorithms rather than deep learning or neural network-based approaches.

In Project Folder,

Project -> Have two Folders and the Image set folder which we have used.

a)New Pipeline Folder -> Have the Newly Developed Pipeline. Code is in "FINAL_PIPELINE.ipynb" python Notebook file.

b)Research -> Have the Implementation of the Research Paper Pipeline. Code is in "Research_paper_implementation.ipynb" python Notebook file.

c)Images_set -> Have all the images we have tested or tried during the execution or can use the drive link to access-> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gmigFfmaADStGr3p7XwbogWIdOxGfQRe?usp=drive_link

->We have used the Google colab to run the notebook files. Download the notebook file and run directly on the google colab. 
Or 
you need to download the image set and mention the path of the folder and run it on VScode or jupyter Notebook.
